# Project
# API 1
## Original Concept
Generate a picture of space (for now) using Nasa API with description and author information, if time allows possibly allow user to pick from calendar to pull back a specific picture

### Current Functionality
- API Call
  - When user loads page a API call is done using todays date.
  - When user selects a date from the date picker and clicks the button a new API call is done to get that days picture
- Date picker
  - Loads current date when page loads
  - Limits users from picking dates in the future

### Nasa API Notes
- Code to render this API to webpage needs to be done within the if statement of the API call
- Need to introduce error message windows and replace any alerts
- Handle errors with if statement
